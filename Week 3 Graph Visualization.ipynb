    "\n",
    "1. Load a graph database of your choosing from a text file or other source.  If you take a large network dataset from the web (such as from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection), please feel free at this point to load just a small subset of the nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create basic analysis on the graph, including the graph’s diameter, and at least one other metric of your choosing.  You may either code the functions by hand (to build your intuition and insight), or use functions in an existing package. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use a visualization tool of your choice (Neo4j, Gephi, etc.) to display information.\n",

    "4. Please record a short video (~ 5 minutes), and submit a link to the video in advance of our meet-up."

This tight diameter is due to the fact that the first 1,000 rows taken from the dataset is not random, and probably represents overlapping friend groups."

Because of this we will see on the subgraph that our network is very dense. I also chose to calculate degree, betweenness and closeness centrality, from the results we can see that node 0 exhibits extreme interconnectedness. The subset likely contains mainly node 0's \"friend list\". Node 0 is connected to almost all other nodes. Node 34 notably does not appear on the top 5 of closeness or degree, but is number 2 for betweeness, Node 34 serves as an important part to connect different groups in the network."
